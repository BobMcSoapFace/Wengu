To use the app, download the [APK file](app-debug.apk) and use an Android emulator such as MEmu Play (has ads, what I used to test) or BlueStacks (also has ads) to run the android app. 

Upload the APK file to the emulator to download it on the emulated device, often using a button on the side that reads APK which prompts a file upload.
