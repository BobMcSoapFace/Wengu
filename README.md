# Wengu
To use the app, download the [APK file]([app-debug.apk](https://github.com/BobMcSoapFace/Wengu/blob/5f7605575a98e4428b7d0b48265a6ec98263159f/app-debug.apk)) and use an Android emulator such as MEmu Play (has ads, what I used to test) or BlueStacks (also has ads) to run the android app. 

Upload the APK file to the emulator to download it on the emulated device, often using a button on the side that reads APK on the icon.
